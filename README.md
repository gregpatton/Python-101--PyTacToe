Python-101--PyTacToe
====================

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game developed so I can get more comfortable programming in Python.

My 7 year old daughter loves this program.  On its turn, The Computer AI simply plays random moves which is about the equivalent of playing a 5 year old kid.  My daughter loves that she can win most games.
